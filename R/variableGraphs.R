# To deal with functions and global variables, we need to know
# where the function is defined. We can see if it exists and use that definition, but this is potentially problematic.
# If we have the script,  we can look for the definition there. Again, we have to be careful about conditional
# definitions.  Also, if we have a source() in the script, we can follow that.
#
# Once we have the function, we can use getGlobals() to find its global variables.
# Then we add those to variables on which the current output from the call depends.
# Should we do this here just for the graph, in getVariableDepends, or in  getInputs
# and add the variables to the inputs. We can merge the globals with the regular inputs
# but make want to keep them separate.

# See getFunctionGlobals() for a script and related functions in getFunctions.R
#

# See existing makeVariableGraph()
